# WHERE IT ALL BEGAN

###### 01.ONE WHO KNOWS PRICE OF EVERYTHING & VALUE OF NOTHING
Nothing in my evil life so far suggests that I have had anything to do with fashion. I am the quintessential bean counter, a dweeb whose life revolves around structures, balance sheets, research and everything mundane you can imagine. To add a cherry on this nerd-cake that I am, my life partner is a cancer surgeon, whose best friends are medical podcasts & his youtube feed filled with the surgical videos which he for some reason finds utterly captivating.

###### 02.BEAUTY SHOULD NOT BE AN END IN ITSELF
Just because it looks beautiful, it is not a reason enough for me to wear it. To the bean counter in me, it has to make sense objectively. It has to enable me in my day to day life. It needs to accentuate my existence while staying in background.

###### 03.SHE IS FASHION
To my untrained mind, fashion is supposed to make me run if I was walking earlier. It needs to bring the real-me who is stunning, out in front of the world to see and acknowledge.

###### 04.GOOD DESIGN IS BEAUTY AND UTILITY MERGING
To my mind, beauty and efficiency are not mutually exclusive. They are byproducts of each other. Beauty is not an option, so is efficiency and utility. As thinking functioning human beings surrounded by so many colors and armaments at our disposal, it is our duty to imagine products that induce functional delight accompanied by beautiful, uplifting vision.

# ISADORA LIFE IS BORN

Isadora Life, born in one of the youngest states of India, Chattisgarh, is an endeavor to embed ease of use and beauty together. At Isadora Life, we create every product with her customer at the core. Everything we do here has one single agenda – Enable you to express your awesome self.

Our products are meant to make you feel good and look even better with delightful ease and speed. We want to free your time so that you can do everything you dream of, while looking good effortlessly.

###### 03.Saree wearing challenge

Wearing a perfect saree feels like a challenge to most of us women and most of the time, we have more pressing engagements than indulge this challenge.

###### 04.Glamour and fear, at once

Saree brings out the absolute feminine power and grace in every woman who adorns it. Saree, 9 yards of pure sensuality and tradition is an attire every woman loves and dreads in equal proportion. The sheer complexity and time it takes to drape a saree makes it nonviable in today’s times.

### WRAP IN 1 MINUTE SAREE - CREATED

With our Wrap in 1 Minute Saree collection, we hope to make saree your go-to-attire for every occasion you wish to stand out or make your personality felt.
