# RESULTS. RESPONSIBILITY

Nature Derma was created with one singular purpose, to be a responsible active skincare brand that makes products that are a careful balance of potent and protective. And that’s why every product we create combines potent actives and Natural Biome Boost™ Solution that protects your skin and strengthens the skin barrier with every use.

# THE NATURE DERMA DIFFERENCE. NATURAL BIOME BOOST™ SOLUTION

One crucial question has shaped each product we develop, it directs our process, and channels our energy, ‘Is this product as protective as it is effective?’. And only when that question is answered with a resounding ‘Yes’ are we satisfied. And the reason for our satisfaction, is our own unique formulation; Natural Biome BoostTM Solution, sourced from Arctium Lappa, also known as the Great Burdock Root, Natural Biome-BoostTM Solution protects, nurtures and strengthens the skin’s natural microbiome barrier. This barrier helps protect the skin against environmental stressors.

# QUALITY. EFFICACY

All our formulations have been developed in France, after two gruelling years of conscientious research. Where every ingredient has been analysed, tried and tested, time and time again, because we believe in Results with Responsibility. In solutions that last a lifetime, and make you feel better about your skin with each application.

> Every product we make is designed to be as effective as it is protective. And is free from harmful sulphates, dyes, parabens, mineral oils, alcohols, fragrances, and silicones.
