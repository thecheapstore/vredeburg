## More about Udacity :

### Upskilling talent for the careers of the future

Udacity began when Stanford instructors Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig had a revolutionary idea to offer their "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" course online—to anyone, for free.

Over 160,000 students in more than 190 countries enrolled, demanding a new way to deliver education. A startling discovery emerged: The top 400 students weren’t from Stanford. This revelation sparked a mission to make lifelong learning more equitable and inclusive. Udacity has been expanding opportunities ever since. Udacity is now part of Accenture.

### Driving outcomes that empower learners, organizations and nations

Udacity’s proven playbook is globally scalable, addressing the widespread digital talent shortages that impact growth, productivity, and innovation.
